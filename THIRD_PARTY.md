## Changes made to the copies

The first commit on the `chore/shared-skills` branch holds the files verbatim; later commits
show every edit. Summary:

- Removed the `superpowers:` plugin prefix from skill cross-references (names are plain here).
- `docs/superpowers/plans|specs/` → `docs/plans/` and `docs/specs/`. Scratch state still goes
  to `.superpowers/` (git-ignored).
- `executing-plans`: removed a pointer to the `using-superpowers` skill, which is not copied.
- `code-review`: issue tracker is GitHub Issues instead of `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.
- `domain-modeling`: glossary is `ai/context/glossary.md` and ADRs are `docs/decision/`.

## Not copied on purpose

Upstream `superpowers` ships a session hook that forces skill use at every session start, and
a skill that explains it (`using-superpowers`). Neither is copied; `AGENTS.md` tells agents
when to use which skill instead.

## Updating a copied skill

Do it in a PR: diff against the upstream version, re-apply the changes listed above, then
update the version in the table. Never edit a copied skill silently.
